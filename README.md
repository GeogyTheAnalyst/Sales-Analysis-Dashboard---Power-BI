# Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project offered me the opportunity to showcases my ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets.

In this project, dived into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights with the aim of analysing sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

Power BI tools were used to uncover valuable insights, explore sales trends, identify bestselling products, calculate revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margin, and create visualizations to present my findings effectively.
